# Application project skeleton

This folder contains everything you need to start building the Code at Uni javascript application.

## Why aren't I starting from scratch?

While it's entirely possible to start from scratch, it's very uncommon for any developer, beginner or seasoned pro, to begin with an empty project folder.

Starting with a project skeleton and boilerplate code (setup code that's been written for us) means we can learn about things in the right order. We won't get sidetracked trying to fix typos in code that we need but isn't crucial to the overall learning objectives.

(Incidentally, professional developers use boilerplate code all the time to save time and to avoid reinventing the wheel ie building common software components that are available off the shelf.)

Every code file provided in this project includes comments and every folder includes a README. You're encouraged to have a look around and understand the purpose of included code. After the course you'll have developed the confidence, knowledge and hopefully hunger to dive into these parts of your application and start messing around. That's what learning to code is all about!

## `package.json`

This file is the master configuration file for your project. This is where we keep track of which libraries and frameworks we use in the application. You won't need to edit yours very much, if at all, to complete the course. Ask your instructor if you have questions about its contents.

`package.json` files following a standard set of rules which make it easy to share node.js projects with other developers. When someone gives you a project with a `package.json`, running one command _should_ be all you need to get up and running. You can read more about them [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/using-a-package.json).

## Project structure

This section will explain the purpose of each folder and its contents at a high level. Follow the links to each folder's README for an extended explanation.

- `public` - [link to README](public/README.md)
- `views` - [link to README](views/README.md)
  - `views/partials` - [link to README](views/partials/README.md)
