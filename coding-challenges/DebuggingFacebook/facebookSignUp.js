/*

Congratulations on making it to part two of Objects! This section
is about using your new knowlege to debug a small program.

Imagine you're a contracted engineer brought on by Facebook to fix 
some of their internal bugs. The programmer before you
made a lot of mistakes and its your job to use your new knowledge
to clean up the mess.

Even though they weren't a very good programmer, they
were VERY thorough about leaving comments. Read the 
comments to get tips about the bugs as well as insights
into new information about JavaScript.

This section focuses on Objects. The code is running with pretty
limited functionality. Throughout the day we'll fix bugs,
which will unlock more robust functionality so that you can see
how your fundamentals will be used in the wild.

*TIPS*

1. Each function depends on the one before it. 
Don't uncomment the next function until you've fixed the 
previous one. 

2. This is a bug treasure hunt. It is up to you to
find and fix the bugs in given parts of the program. Some
mistakes are obvious, others are not -- attention to detail is key.

3. The console is your friend and will *usually* lead you in the
right direction to the next bug.

4. If you don't recognize something look it up. The internet
is every programmer's best friend - make sure you utilize it and expand
your programming knowlege. Full time engineers use Google and
StackOverflow constantly- this is a part of your required learning. 

5. Have fun, if you're stuck for too long it becomes tedious.
Don't feel bad for using the hints, these are tough exercises!

// Here we make our facebookUser form which, in this case,

 Follow the console, 1 bug will lead to the next.
